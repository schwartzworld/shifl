"""The SAMPLE engine's built-in sets, hip-hop edition: writes the WAVs gen_samples.py builds into
the firmware, under assets/samples-cc0/<SET>/ (all CC0; CREDITS.txt next to them).

    python tools/gen_builtin_hiphop.py      (numpy, scipy, soundfile; fetches the sources once)

Sets (gen_samples.py CC0_SETS gives their order and kind; PIANO, the grand, is cut from VCSL as
ATTRIBUTION.txt lists):
  BASS   jazz upright bass, pizz   (VSCO-2 CE Solo Contrabass) - two octaves under the keys
  VIBES  vibraphone, hard mallets  (VCSL)
  HORNS  trumpet + trombone stabs  (VSCO-2 CE)
  STRGS  violin + viola stabs      (VSCO-2 CE)
  FLUTE  kept as it was            (VSCO-2 CE, tools/fetch_cc0.py)
  SCRCH  scratch, backspin, rewind (Sonic Pi sample set, CC0)
Every file is named NN_<note>_m<MIDI root>.wav: gen_samples.py takes the root from _m<n>.
The chain (retune to A440, then the "dusty" record / old sampler colour) is gen_hiphop_pack.py's.
